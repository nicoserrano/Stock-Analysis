# Stock Analysis
##### Automating the analysis of multiple renewable energy stocks using VBA
---

## Overview
This report will analyze the data for 2018 and 2017 of 12 renewable energy stocks including Atlantica Yield, Canadian Solar, Daqo New Energy Group, Enphase Energy, First Solar, Hannon Armstrong Inc., Jinko Solar, SunRun, SolarEdge, SunPower, Terraform Power, and Vivint Solar. The goal is to automate the formatting and analysis using VBA in order to output the yearly return and total volume for each stock. After creating the first draft of working code (Module 1: draftCode), I decided to *refactor* it to come up with a **design pattern** (Module 2: VBA_Challenge) with improved code performance that could be used on any sotck data.
